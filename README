NAME
    hn-profile - Hacker News Profile Dumper

USAGE
    hn-profile [options]

OPTIONS
    -h --help

            Print the help message

    -v --verbose

            An accumulating counter that starts at 0.  The higher the verbosity
            level, the more information that gets spit back at you. Note that
            this may get mixed in with the JSON output if you aren't sending it
            to a file.

    -f --file=FILE

            The file to dump the JSON to. By default, the JSON will be printed
            to STDOUT, so if you want to send it anywhere else, you'll have to
            use this option.

    -s --saved-articles

            Parse the 'saved articles' section of your Hacker News profile.
            This requires that you set the $user_id and $password globals in the
            script.  (Note: Login info handling is on the todo list to improve.)

DESCRIPTION
    A command to extract the information from your user profile. It's especially
    useful for parsing out your 'saved articles' (aka the list of links that
    you've upvoted) because they are only displayed 30/page, and the 'next' link
    is seemingly auto-generated each time (and expires), so there is no easy way
    to extract this data without walking the list from most to least recent.
