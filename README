NAME
    hn-profile - Hacker News Profile Dumper

USAGE
    hn-profile [options]

OPTIONS
    -h --help

            Print the help message

    -v --verbose

            An accumulating counter that starts at 0.  The higher the verbosity
            level, the more information that gets spit back at you. Note that
            this may get mixed in with the JSON output if you aren't sending it
            to a file.

    -f --file=FILE

            The file to dump the JSON to. By default, the JSON will be printed
            to STDOUT, so if you want to send it anywhere else, you'll have to
            use this option.

    -s --saved-articles

            Parse the 'saved articles' section of your Hacker News profile.

    -i --general-info

            Parse out the generic information from your HN profile (e.g. karma
            score, avg. rating, etc).

DESCRIPTION
    A command to extract the information from your Hacker News[1] user profile.
    It's especially useful for parsing out your 'saved articles' (aka the list
    of links that you've upvoted) because they are only displayed 30/page, and
    the 'next' link is seemingly auto-generated each time (and expires), so
    there is no easy way to extract this data without walking the list from
    most to least recent.

    Your user_id and password should be specified in your ~/.netrc file. Type
    'man netrc' for more information about the file format.
