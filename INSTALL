On Ubuntu (and possibly Debian):
    apt-get install libwww-mechanize-perl libtry-tiny-perl
    apt-get install libdatetime-perl libjson-perl
    cp hn-profile /path/to/where/you/want/it

If you have Perl 5.10 or greater, Module::Build should be included in the
distribution allowing you to use the Build.PL to install this:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build install

Barring that, you'll need to install the dependencies.
E.g.:

    cpanm DateTime
    cpanm WWW::Mechanize
    cpanm Try::Tiny
    cpanm JSON

And then just copy the hn-profile script to whereever you plan to run it from.
