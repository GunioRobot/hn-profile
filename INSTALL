If you have Perl 5.10 or greater, Module::Build should be included in the
distribution allowing you to use the Build.PL to install this:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build install

Barring that, you'll need to install the dependencies.
E.g.:

    cpanm DateTime
    cpanm WWW::Mechanize
    cpanm Try::Tiny
    cpanm JSON

And then just copy the hn-profile script to whereever you plan to run it from.

Note:
    If you don't know what any of this is, I would suggest just searching for
    'perlbrew' online and following some instructions to get it installed and
    setup. Then make sure to install 'cpanm' (aka CPAN Minus).
